# Convo Dark

> **Status:** Historical Babbage-era demo. This codebase uses the deprecated `@babbage/sdk` / `@babbage/react-prompt` stack and is not representative of the current BSV application stack. New applications should use `@bsv/sdk`, the BRC-100 `WalletClient` interface, `@bsv/message-box-client` for peer-to-peer message delivery, and a compatible wallet such as BSV Desktop, BSV Browser, or another BRC-100 implementation.

This is a fork of the [Convo Messenger codebase](https://github.com/p2ppsr/convo), but for people who would prefer a dark theme.

The purpose is to demonstrate that when two apps use the same blockchain protocols, people can use the apps of their choosing.

Alice likes the Convo UX more, so she uses Convo Messenger. Ty likes dark things, so he can use Convo Dark. Alice and Ty can still talk to one another, and they each get their ideal UX.

Convo Messenger makes money when Alice sends messages in their app, while Convo Dark makes money when Ty sends his messages in the Dark app. The one with the best UX and lowest commissions will make the most money.

The Convo Dark commission is only taken on 1.5% of transactions, while the Convo commission is taken from 2% of transactions.

## Overview (from the Convo repo)

This is a React app demonstrating the older Babbage application stack with a simple private messaging experience. Treat the implementation as archival reference only.

- The app relies on the deprecated Babbage SDK to provide user accounts, key management and account recovery
- Bridgeport is used to provide a universal state machine backend powered by BSV transactions and real-time message and profile updates
- Hashbrown will soon provide a place to store picture messages and user profile photos
- Current BSV applications should use `@bsv/sdk`, BRC-100 wallets, and the maintained MessageBox client/server packages instead of this stack

## A note on the (ab)use of redux

Some uses of Redux in this application are—shall we say—*unconventional*.

This is due primarily to a lack of sound Redux knowledge on the part of your author. However, I have done my best to ensure that these violations don't impact 
your ability to understand CWI and build your applications.

Try not to be too bothered by the occasional `store.dispatch` inside a React component. Pull requests that address these shortcomings are welcome :)
